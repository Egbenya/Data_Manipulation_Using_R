IMPORTANT INFORMATION

Due to the large size of the original csv dataset, I had to copy the file into an excel document and then save the file in xlsx format. 
So I'll advise that you copy back the dataset from xlsx to csv to get a better feeling on the dataset.
Simply select all the record in the excel file using ctrl+A, then copy ctrl+C. Open a blank csv file anywhere in you PC and paste the copied file usin ctrl+V.


See the attached pdf file in the repository to get a better understanding of the dataset.

Finally, While working on this dataset, I realised that some columns name changed; Probably because of RStudio formating. For example, the original column name "_FRUTSUM" 
was uploaded as "X_FRUTSUM", also the column name '_AGE65YR' was uploaded as 'X_AGE65YR'. So please check your columns name first before coding.
